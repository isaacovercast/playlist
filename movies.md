## Witchy
* [Rabbit Trap (2025)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_Trap) - (12/31/25) 4/5 :sparkles: Slow burn, quiet and haunting. Dont mess with fairy circles. Opens many doors that are never closed, and the music and sound design are nice so it could be worth a second look.
* [November (2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_(2017_film)) - (01/02/26) 4.5/5 :sparkles: Beautiful, hypnotic, full of dream logic. Estonian mythology. Shot in B/W and saturated with imagery.
* [Midsommar (2019; A24)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsommar) - (01/04/26) 3.7/5 :sparkles: A nice watch but probably don't need to see it again. The main characters are pretty flat, and it's mostly obvious what will happen and why.
